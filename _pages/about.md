I am a Postdoc in the Computational and Cognitive Neuroscience Lab at the University of Michigan. My research interests focus on the use of neuroimaging methods including EEG, fMRI and MRS, and revolve around trying to understand the architecture and behavior of complex brain networks which underlie normal and pathological brain states.

I received my PhD from the University of Nottingham, where I worked with Professor Peter Liddle, investigating cerebral connectivity in psychosis.
